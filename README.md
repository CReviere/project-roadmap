# Crosscloud project roadmap

## Widgets/components:

 * [x] login/signup
 * [ ] WebID keychain
 * [ ] person/group picker (with the option to invite new users)
 * [ ] groups manager (with delegation of admin rights)
 * [ ] contacts manager
 * [x] [partial] ACL manager

Important: allow override of default widget based on user preference -- login, keychain and ACL manager need to be trusted.

@@TODO add description for each item, together with estimated time of completion

##Form builder:

 * [ ] pick subclasses
 * [ ] checkbox
 * [ ] text
 * [ ] images
 * [ ] file picker

##Servers:

 * [ ] donâ€™t sniff triples to detect mime types
